## Hi, I’m Ethan Epperson!

Welcome to my personal portfolio and blog site!

I’m Ethan Epperson, a senior at the University of Louisville, where I’m majoring in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity and Data Analytics. Cybersecurity has always drawn me in because it’s not just about protecting data, it’s a people-first industry, and arming others with knowledge is why I’m here.

On this site, you’ll find a collection of blog posts that not only document my journey and discoveries but also serve as a resource for fellow students and new learners in the cybersecurity field. Writing these posts helps reinforce my own learning while offering valuable information to others who are just starting out or looking to deepen their understanding.

In addition to blogging, I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which challenge and enhance my skills in real-world scenarios. My primary interests are in web application security and offensive security, areas that I find both challenging and rewarding.

Thanks for visiting my site. I hope you find the content helpful and engaging as we navigate our cyber learning journey together!
