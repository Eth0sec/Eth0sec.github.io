## Painfully Nonpersistent

Hereâ€™s the setup:

You have two separate web applications, `App 1` and `App 2` running on two different EC2 instances, `Instance1` and `Instance2`. Both applications are served through a single AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB). Seems fine, right? However, this simple setup can be problematic and result in some headaches for end-users. Letâ€™s take a look at why that is.

## What Can Happen?

### 1. Apparent Successful Login

**Situation**: The user logs into `App 1` successfully on `Instance 1`, but when they use the ALB to access the application, theyâ€™re redirected to `App2` on `Instance 2`.

**Possible Outcome**:

- If `App 2` on `Instance 2` does not have access to the session information from `App 1`, the user might be redirected to `App2` and see it as if they have logged in, but `App 2` will not recognize their session from `App1`.
- `App 2` might not have any indication that the user is already logged in on `App 1`. Thus, it might prompt the user to log in again or show an interface indicating that they are not logged in.

### 2. Inability to Login

**Situation**: The user logs into `App 1` on `Instance 1`, and then accesses the ALB, which directs them to `App 2` on `Instance 2`.

**Possible Outcome**:

- When the user is routed to `App 2`, `App 2` has no session information from `App 1`. This means that the user is effectively logged out when they are directed to `App 2`.
- The user might be unable to access the features or content available to logged-in users because `App 2` does not recognize their session or credentials, leading to a login failure or prompt.

That my friend, has to do with a lack of session persistence, or sticky sessions as they are called in AWS. Wellâ€¦what are they? Sticky sessions are used by application load balancers to ensure that a userâ€™s session is consistently routed to the same server or instance throughout their interaction with a web application.

It ensures problems like the examples above canâ€™t happen to an end-user, and is a crucial concept for applications that require user data to be maintained across multiple requests. User sessions on e-commerce sites and login-based applications rely on sticky sessions.

## How Do Sticky Sessions Work?

Sticky sessions with AWSâ€™s Application Load Balancer (ALB) are all about keeping things consistent for your users. Hereâ€™s the lowdown on the two stickiness methods you can choose.

### 1. App-Based Cookies

Your app can issue its own AWSALB cookie to track which instance should handle a userâ€™s requests. This cookie lets the load balancer know exactly where to send the traffic, making sure users stay with the same server throughout their session.

### 2. Load Balancer-Generated Cookies

ALB: If you let the load balancer handle it, it automatically sets an AWSALB (or AWSALBCORS for CORS setups) cookie. This cookie keeps track of the instance serving the user, so theyâ€™re routed back to the same one without any extra fuss.

Hereâ€™s a simplified look at how a load balancer-generated cookies work.

## Setting Up Sticky Sessions

Follow the steps below to turn on stickiness for your target group of instances:

1. Under `Load Balancing`, choose `Target Groups`, then `Attributes`, and finally click `Edit`.
2. Scroll down to the `Target selection configuration` and check the box to turn stickiness.
3. Leave the type as `Load balancer generated cookie`.
4. Choose whatever stickiness duration you desire.
5. Leave `Cross-zone load balancing` as is.
6. Click `Save changes`.

Itâ€™s as simple as that. Session stickiness should now be active for all instances of the target group.

## Conclusion + Food For Thought

Navigating multiple web applications behind an ALB can be a balancing act of its own. To keep user sessions smooth and seamless, hereâ€™s what you should focus on:

- **Sticky Sessions**: Think of them as a GPS for user traffic â€” once a user is connected to a specific instance, they stay on the same path for the rest of their session.
- **Session Harmony**: You want your sessions to be in harmony. Applying consistent strategies across your apps helps them avoid dissonance.
- **ALB Configuration**: Double-check your ALB setup to make sure itâ€™s directing your traffic smoothly like butter ðŸ§ˆ.
